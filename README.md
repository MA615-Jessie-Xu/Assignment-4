# Assignment-4

### Task ONE: Pick a book

### Task TWO: bag of words analysis
As shown in Chapter 2 of Text Mining with R do a sentiment display through the narrative of your book. You should choose an index length and a sentiment dictionary that gives you the best fit between the plotline of the book and the graph that you create. If you donâ€™t know the plot line of the book, you will need to either skim or refer to a synopsis.

### Task THREE: sentence-level analysis
Truenumbers provides data organization and tools that can be used for text analysis. To get started, use the ingestion function in Book2TN-v3.R load your book into a number space. The example that is included with this assignment provides working code that shows how to use Book2TN-v3.R.
Now, with the book tokenized by sentence, paragraph, and chapter, use functions from the tnum package for the three text analysis tasks below.
Use the sentimentr package to produce a sentence level sentiment analysis of your book. See Sentiment analysis in r with sentimentr. Compare this analysis with the analysis you did in Task TWO. Can you make adjustments so that the two analyses are comparable

### EXTRA CREDIT: character analysis
Pick two characters from your book. Use tags to track the characters individually as their names appear in paragraphs. Create truenumbers for the number of times each character appears in each chapter and the number of times both characters appear in the same paragraphs.
Use character tracking and other data from truenumbers tp produce visualizations of the characters' story lines through the book.
